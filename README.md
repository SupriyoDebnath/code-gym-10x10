# CODE GYM 10x10

Hi visitors, my name is Supriyo Debnath and I decided to start this self-development project to spend my off-duty hours with coding & configuring new techs.

**Code Gym 10x10** is a playground where I would create 10 modular SaaS applications by leveraging 10 leading technolgies in current industry. I have spent over 13 years in Software Industry, and nothing ever felt enough to appease my hunger for learning new tech. I invite you to join my network, and learn more about me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/supriyodebnath/)
